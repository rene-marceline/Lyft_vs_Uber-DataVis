# Ride-Sharing Price Comparison: Lyft vs Uber

## Introduction

The debate over ride-sharing services, particularly between Uber and Lyft, has been a subject of discussion, especially among college students who prioritize affordability. This project delves into the controversy by comparing the pricing of Lyft and Uber, focusing on data from November to December '18. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma), and Python, along with Pandas, is utilized for data processing. The analysis centers on the Price and Time of the Day attributes for a comprehensive understanding.

## Left Chart: Pro-Lyft Perspective

The left chart presents a bar chart illustrating the Average Price ($) against different times of the day for both Lyft and Uber. It becomes evident from the visualization that Lyft cabs are priced more competitively than Uber cabs. Rhetorical techniques, including color choices and annotations, are strategically employed to emphasize Lyft's affordability.

## Right Chart: Pro-Uber Perspective

On the right, another chart displays the Average Price ($) for different times of the day. Contrary to the left chart, Uber cabs are showcased as more affordable throughout the day when compared to Lyft. Rhetorical techniques, possibly involving color contrast, are implemented to highlight Uber's affordability.

## Rhetorics

Several rhetorical techniques contribute to the persuasive presentation:
- **Obscuring:** Additional data points for Lyft in the left chart support the argument.
- **Anchoring:** Highlighted bars with yellow draw attention to the winning company in both charts.
- **Comparison:** Differentiating Lyft and Uber using colors aids in visual contrast.
- **Provenance:** Cited links to the data source enhance transparency.
- **Cultural Codes:** Logos added to each chart suggest the interpretation that the corresponding company is the winner.
